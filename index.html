          <td><a href="https://github.com/elliotbabilonia/rental-pricing-explore-normal">First Lab TKH</a></td>
          <td>The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the housing market to help them make informed decisions on rental property pricing. By conducting exploratory data analysis, cleaning and preparing the dataset, and building a predictive model, we aim to uncover critical insights into factors influencing rental prices.</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/elliotbabilonia/bank-activity">Second Lab TKH</a></td>
          <td>The purpose of this project is to engineer a Python-based data pipeline for analyzing stock data. The pipeline will be used to restructure large volumes of stock data, which will then be integrated with daily news headline data to measure how reliably sentiment predicts stock prices.</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/elliotbabilonia/shopping-data-analytics">Fifth Lab TKH</a></td>
          <td>In this project, I began by meticulously exploring and structuring a shopping dataset, delving into seasonal trends, color preferences, and clothing item popularity. Through insightful visualizations, I identified patterns such as the influence of promo-codes on spending habits, the timing of user reviews, and the impact of demographic factors on purchasing behavior.</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/elliotbabilonia/automobile-projectl">First Group Project TKH</a></td>
          <td>This project centers around the intricate task of automobile modeling, where an in-depth analysis is conducted on diverse variables within a structured dataframe. The primary objective is to unravel the intricate relationships and dependencies that exist.</td>
